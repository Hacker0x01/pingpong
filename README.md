## The laws

### Walking directions

### Lives
- Every player gets one life at the start of every round.
- When a player wins a finale he will win a life.
- Lives can be accumulated, there is no maximum.
- Players losing a life are required to shout the number of remaining lives. A player lost his second-to-last life is required to shout ["reset"](#vocabulary).
- Players without any lives left lost the round.
- Quitting the round voluntarily will automatically destroy all accumulated lives â€“ it's either win or lose.

## Introducing new laws
Please make a pull request and the elderly of the table will decide if it's merge-worthy.
