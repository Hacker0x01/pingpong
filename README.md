## The laws

### Walking directions

### Lives
- Every player gets one life at the start of every round.
- When a player wins a finale he will win a life.
- Lives can be accumulated, there is no maximum.
- Players losing a life are required to shout the number of remaining lives. A player lost his second-to-last life is required to shout "reset".
- Players without any lives left lost the round.
- Quitting the round voluntarily will automatically destroy all accumulated lives – it's either win or lose.

## Introducing new laws
Please make a pull request and the elderly of the table will decide if it's merge-worthy.

## TODO:

Write something about:
- how to get a life
- when to use your life
- walking directions
- obstacle rules
- direct response
- table touch
- vocabulary ("In the just", "laughing plural", "good seeing", "life taker")
- the classics (dirk, philip)
- why you are not jens enough
- tinus (half) time
- voting when in disagreement
- cutting back into the line, even when you're out of the game
