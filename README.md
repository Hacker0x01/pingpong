## The laws

### Walking directions

### Lives
- Every player gets one life at the start of every round.
- When a player wins a finale he will win a life.
- Lives can be accumulated, there is no maximum.
- Players losing a life are required to shout the number of remaining lives. A player lost his second-to-last life is required to shout ["reset"](#vocabulary).
- Players without any lives left lost the round.
- Quitting the round voluntarily will automatically destroy all accumulated lives â€“ it's either win or lose.

### Direct Response
- Direct Response is a move where you would directly hit the opponent's ball back without the ball having touched your side of the table.
- It's illegal to do a Direct Response when the opponent just served.
- Players can do a Direct Response as you as you don't cross the net/["just"](#vocabulary)

### Tinus (Half) Time
- Tinus Half Time and Tinus Time only occurs during a final battle between the last two remaining players.
- Tinus Half Time is when one of the two finalists makes his first point. It is not allowed to join the table yet, but it's recommended to prepare for it.
- Tinus Time is when it's a 1:1 score between the two finalist. It's allowed for the other players to join the table, creating pressure for the finalists to fail. Shouting is recommended.

*Fun fact: Tinus Time is named after the famous player blocker [@martijnrusschen](https://github.com/martijnrusschen)*, who always prematurely joined the table before the finalists were finished.

### Obstacles
- It's allowed to ["gandalf"](#vocabulary) another player. This often happens during [Tinus Time](#tinus-half-time) or when a player is deliberately trying to sabotage the other. 
- The blocked player has to shout "gandalf" and make an effort to still try to hit back the ball, preferrably hitting the blocker with the ping pong bat.

### Table Touch
It's allowed to touch the table to support your body weight to smash the opponent by bending over the player's side of the table.

## Introducing new laws
Please make a pull request and the elderly of the table will decide if it's merge-worthy.

## TODO:

Write something about:
- walking directions
- vocabulary ("In the just", "laughing plural", "good seeing", "life taker", "life saver")
- the classics (dirk, philip)
- why you are not jens enough
- voting when in disagreement
- cutting back into the line, even when you're out of the game (aka ghost membering)
- saving another player's life
